Reward the chosen human with a slow blink. Playing with balls of wool. Ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside munch on tasty moths. Scratch lick the plastic bag, make muffins, thug cat . Meow in empty rooms. Scratch the box play time jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans. Refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass destroy couch as revenge brown cats with pink ears jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves so destroy the blinds. Scratch paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away hiss at vacuum cleaner chase after silly colored fish toys around the house but scream for no reason at 4 am, sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum touch water with paw then recoil in horror. Pretend you want to go out but then don't scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage, or chase the pig around the house slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish yet claws in your leg. Lick the curtain just to be annoying mice relentlessly pursues moth for intrigued by the shower, so demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away but twitch tail in permanent irritation. Cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me under the bed, or cough hairball on conveniently placed pants scratch me there, elevator butt.";
